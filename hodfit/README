Pablo Arnalte-Mur -- 20/01/2015

In this directory, I plan to implement a "complete" HOD model for
2-point clustering, based on the Coupon et al. (2002) model.
It will be based on the previous "simple model" (which is working
in its basic way in version 0.1 of the code). 

I will progressively implement the needed changes to "complicate the model",
keeping the description of the current implemented model in "model_definition.tex".

When practical, I will try to leave as an option the use of the previous "simple"
model, as this may be useful for comparisons/speed/...
