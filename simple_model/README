In this directory, we plan to implement a complete "simple" HOD model for 
2-point clustering, based on the Coupon et al. (2002) model. The differences
with respect to this model (which make this "simpler") are these:

- Do not consider the scale-dependent halo bias (eq. A13)
- Do not consider the exclusion effect in the 2-halo term: Mlim(r) in eq. (A20),
  and the related calculations in eqs. (A21-A24)
- Do not consider Mvir(r) limit in the 1-halo central-satellite term (eq. A17)
- Allow use of different HOD models (probably simpler)
- Use the halo model (mass function, bias function) from Mo&White (2002) instead of those from Sheth&Tormen (1999), Sheth et al. (2001)

Part of this code will be based in older, partially buggy code in the
'old_reference_code' directory.
